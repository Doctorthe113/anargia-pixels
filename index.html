        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a graphics designer based with expertise in Inkscape, Canva and Gimp.
            I started my journey a few years ago, back then I only made logos 
            in Canva. But since this year, I also started doing graphics designing
            in Inkscape. You will be able to see some of my work below.
        </p>
        <h2>Why hire me?</h2>
        <p>I am very passionate about my work. I deliver beautiful logos, stickers,
            banners and more at an afforadable price with multiple revisions to ensure
            client's satisfaction.
            <br>
            I believe a logo is a company's face. It makes the first impression on
            potential customers. A logo should convey a messeage to the customers
            about the business' quality and motto.
            <br>
            Fun fact, this website was built from scratch with all the assets 
            made by me. This website is part of the portfolio itself.
